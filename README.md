## Getting Started

This project grew out of my experience of learning how to build ui component libraries from `antdv` and `element-plus`.

I will compare `antdv` and `el+` in various aspectsï¼Œand explain why I prefer one of them in some aspects.

Here are the techniques involved:

- Vue3 / Typescript / JSX / Gulp / Rollup
